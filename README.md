## Description
This website enables users to explore a variety of ***Italian*** recipes. Users have the flexibility to create, modify, and remove recipes from their account, and they can also contribute recipes from the site's collection.

This website is made using the following tech stack:
  1. **HTML**.
  2. **CSS**.
  3. **JavaScript**.

I encountered several hurdles while developing this website, particularly during the design phase. I found myself restructuring a significant portion of my code to adapt to necessary adjustments, particularly when optimizing for responsiveness. While initial reviews have made me believe it is a good design, I think I would prefer to work with a designer on any future project while I get better at web designs.
