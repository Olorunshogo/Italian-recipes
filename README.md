I encountered several hurdles while developing this website, particularly during the design phase. I found myself restructuring a significant portion of my code to adapt to necessary adjustments, particularly when optimizing for responsiveness.

I would like to make all form and input fields to submit and be functional. And also, make the subscribe button prompt a modal of a form to subscribe to newsletters.
